Brand Voice & Copy Rules

All copy, UI text, marketing, and AI-generated content must follow these rules.


The voice is:
- Informal, modern, and human
- Confident without bravado
- Professional without stiffness
- Reassuring without sentimentality
- Dryly witty without trying to be funny

If the copy feels clever, edgy, salesy, or performative — it is wrong.

## Core Voice Principles

### 1. Clear & Plainspoken
- Prefer everyday language
- Short sentences
- Minimal jargon
- Clarity over cleverness

Correct:
> "Get care sorted quickly, without the runaround."

Incorrect:
> "Experience a seamless asynchronous telehealth solution."

---

### 2. Confident & Expert
- State facts plainly
- No hype language
- No hedging ("we aim to", "we try to")

Correct:
> "Reviewed by Australian-registered doctors."

Incorrect:
> "We strive to deliver best-in-class healthcare experiences."

---

### 3. Informal but Respectful
- Friendly, not casual
- Never slangy
- Never condescending

Correct:
> "Fill out a quick consult. We'll take it from there."

Incorrect:
> "Hop in and smash out a form 👍"

---

### 4. Dry Wit (Optional, Light)
- Wit is optional, never required
- Max one subtle line per section
- If it draws attention to itself, remove it

Acceptable:
> "No waiting rooms. No awkward small talk."

Unacceptable:
> "Healthcare, but make it painless 😏"

## Emoji Usage Rules

Emojis are **supporting signals**, not decoration.

### Allowed
- 0–1 emoji per block
- Used to soften tone or add warmth
- Neutral emojis only: 🙂 👍 ⏱️ ✅ 🌤️

### Forbidden
- Emojis in headings (except short UI labels)
- Medical emojis (💊🩺💉)
- Meme / edgy emojis (😈🔥💀)

If the emoji is noticeable without the text — remove it.

## Medical Advertising & Compliance Rules (Critical)

These rules exist to:
- Prevent Google Ads disapproval
- Reduce AHPRA scrutiny
- Maintain a clinic-first posture

### Never Use on Landing Pages
- Medication names or drug classes
- "Prescription" as a selling hook
- "Scripts", "Rx", "meds", "pharmaceutical"
- Guaranteed outcomes
- Instant approval language

Avoid:
> "Get prescriptions online"  
> "Instant scripts"  
> "Approved in minutes"  
> "No doctor interaction required"

---

### Preferred Framing
Always use **process-first, clinician-led language**.

Allowed:
- "Doctor review"
- "Medical assessment"
- "Clinician-reviewed requests"
- "Appropriate care, decided by a doctor"

Avoid:
- "Fast prescription delivery"
- "Script renewal without seeing a doctor"

---

## Subtle 'No Call' Incentive Rule

We **do not advertise** "no call" or "async consults".

We **quietly reassure** instead.

### Allowed (secondary only)
- "Most requests don't require a call"
- "Usually no phone call needed"
- "If a call is needed, we'll let you know"

Used as:
- Small green pill text
- Soft glow
- Supporting UI copy

### Forbidden
- Headlines or CTAs about "no calls"
- Aggressive framing ("hate talking to a doctor?")
- Anything implying bypassing clinical judgment

Tone must remain:
> calm, optional, clinician-led

---

## Final Voice Test (Non-Negotiable)

Every piece of copy must pass this test:

Would this sound reasonable coming from a calm, experienced doctor
explaining things to a normal person?

If not — rewrite.
