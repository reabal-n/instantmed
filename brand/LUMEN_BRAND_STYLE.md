# Lumen Health — Brand Style & Visual Personality

> **Version 1.0** — Source of Truth

## Brand Essence

**Lumen Health represents clarity emerging, not speed or disruption.**

The brand is defined by calm authority, morning light, and good judgment.

- Lumen does not shout.
- Lumen does not rush.
- Lumen illuminates.

*If a design choice feels impressive but loud, it is wrong.*

---

## Core Brand Pillars

### 1. Clarity over speed
We never visually prioritise urgency, hype, or instant gratification.
The brand communicates confidence through restraint.

### 2. Light as guidance, not decoration
Light is environmental and directional — never a graphic object.
The sun is felt, not drawn.

### 3. Premium minimalism
Every element must justify its existence.
If something does not add clarity, it is removed.

### 4. Human, not clinical
We avoid sterile hospital aesthetics and wellness cliché.
The tone is reassuring, not sentimental.

## Visual Hierarchy (Non-Negotiable)

| Priority | Element |
|----------|---------|
| **Primary** | Light |
| **Secondary** | Air / atmosphere |
| **Tertiary** | Glass structure |
| **Last** | Detail |

*If detail competes with light, detail loses.*

---

## Color Philosophy

### Overall Palette
- Soft morning spectrum
- Low saturation
- Natural diffusion

### Allowed Color Families
- Light sky blue
- Pale ivory
- Soft peach
- Warm apricot
- Gentle champagne warmth

### Prohibited Colors
- Purple or violet tones
- Neon or high-saturation hues
- Dark blues associated with night or "AI SaaS"
- Harsh blacks or stark whites

### Contrast Rule
Contrast is achieved through lightness and material, not colour jumps.

---

## Light & Atmosphere Rules

- Light must feel directional (early morning dawn)
- Glow must be diffuse, never rim-lit
- Radial light falloff should be smooth and slow
- No visible sun disks, rays, flares, or beams
- If the sun is identifiable as an object → reject

*The correct question is not "do I see the sun?" — it is "do I feel where the light comes from?"*

---

## Cloud Usage Rules

**Clouds are atmospheric diffusion, not subjects.**

### Allowed
- Minimal cloud forms
- Soft, translucent edges
- Used only to shape light

### Forbidden
- Cloud-heavy compositions
- Blue or purple clouds
- Clouds as decorative objects
- "Weather app" literalism

*If clouds attract attention before light, the design is invalid.*

---

## Glassmorphism Rules

### Material Characteristics
- Frosted, not glossy
- Soft translucency
- Rounded geometry (squircle preferred)

### Blur Discipline
- Blur must preserve structure
- Over-blur is forbidden
- Glass edges must remain readable at small sizes

### Shadows
- Extremely subtle
- Never black or harsh
- Suggest depth, never weight

---

## Shape & Geometry

- Rounded corners only
- No sharp or aggressive geometry
- Forms should feel balanced and stable

*Nothing should feel fast, jagged, or angular.*

---

## Typography Philosophy

**Typography is authoritative and neutral.**

### Principles
- Clean, modern sans-serif for body
- Elegant serif for headings and editorial moments
- Excellent legibility at small sizes
- Medium weights preferred

### Avoid
- Decorative or thematic typography
- "Cloud-shaped" or novelty letterforms
- Techno, sci-fi, or futuristic fonts

*Typography must never compete with the icon. The icon carries poetry. Type carries trust.*

---

## Logo & Icon Rules

### App Icon
- Icon-only, no text
- Sun represented as light, not shape
- Must read clearly at small sizes
- Calm and confident, not illustrative

### Logo Lockups
- Icon + wordmark side-by-side
- Wordmark neutral and restrained
- No effects, shadows, or gradients on type

---

## Motion & Interaction

- Motion is slow, intentional, and subtle
- Easing should feel natural, not energetic
- No bounce, snap, or aggressive acceleration

*Motion exists to confirm, not to impress.*

---

## Emotional Tone

### The brand should feel:
- Calm
- Reassuring
- Intelligent
- Premium
- Human
- Trustworthy

### The brand should never feel:
- Playful
- Cute
- Busy
- Loud
- Sales-driven
- "Startup-y"

---

## Rejection Test (Critical)

**Reject a design immediately if:**
- It feels impressive but anxious
- It prioritises speed over confidence
- It resembles crypto, AI tooling, or productivity SaaS
- It feels like wellness marketing
- It looks better at full size than as an icon

---

## The Final Rule

If someone looks at Lumen Health and thinks:

> "This feels calm. Whoever built this knows what they're doing."

**The brand is correct.**

If they think:

> "This looks cool."

**The brand has failed.**
