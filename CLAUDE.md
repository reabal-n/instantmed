## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev              # Dev server (localhost:3000)
pnpm build            # Production build (8GB heap)
pnpm typecheck        # Type-check without emitting
pnpm lint             # ESLint (flat config)
pnpm test             # Vitest unit tests (268 tests)
pnpm test:watch       # Watch mode
pnpm test:coverage    # With coverage report
pnpm e2e              # Playwright E2E (42+ tests, needs PLAYWRIGHT=1)
pnpm e2e:chromium     # Chromium only (fastest)
pnpm e2e:headed       # Visible browser
pnpm e2e:debug        # Step-through debugger
pnpm ci               # Full CI: install → lint → test → build
```

- Unit tests: `lib/__tests__/**/*.test.ts` — Node environment, not jsdom. 40% coverage threshold.
- E2E tests: `e2e/**/*.spec.ts` — auto-seeds/tears down test data. Auth bypass: `PLAYWRIGHT=1` + `__e2e_auth_user_id` cookie.

## Code Conventions

### Components & Styling
- `"use client"` at top for client components; server components default (no directive)
- `@/` path alias for all imports — always use it
- Tailwind utility classes + `cn()` from `lib/utils` for conditional classes
- shadcn/ui + Radix primitives for all form elements
- CVA (class-variance-authority) for component style variants
- lucide-react exclusively for icons
- Framer Motion via `motion` — always respect `useReducedMotion()`
- DiceBear notionists for avatars (`https://api.dicebear.com/7.x/notionists/svg?seed=...`)

### Form Inputs
- **Yes/no toggles**: shadcn `Switch` (NOT checkboxes)
- **Consent acknowledgments**: shadcn `Checkbox`
- **Form validation**: react-hook-form + Zod schema + `zodResolver`

### State & Data
- Zustand for intake flow state (persisted to localStorage, 24h expiry)
- React hooks for local component state
- SWR for client-side data fetching
- `revalidatePath("/path")` after server mutations

### Server Actions
- Return shape: `{ success: boolean; error?: string; data?: T }`
- Auth: `requireRoleOrNull(["doctor", "admin"])` — returns user or null, non-throwing
- No `console.log` — ESLint errors on `no-console`. Use Sentry for logging

### Component Decision Tree
- **Form elements**: shadcn/ui from `@/components/ui/`
- **Data tables with sort/search/pagination**: `DataTable` from `@/components/uix`
- **Simple display tables**: shadcn `Table` from `@/components/ui/table`
- **Loading states**: `TableSkeleton`, `CardSkeleton`, `FormSkeleton` from `@/components/ui/skeletons`
- **Toasts**: `showSuccess()`, `showError()`, `showPromise()` from `@/lib/ui/toast-config`
- **Error handling**: `ErrorBoundary`, `ErrorRecovery` from `@/components/ui/`
- **Glass morphism**: `GlassCard`, `GlassButton`, `GlassInput` from `@/components/ui/`

## Environment

- **Stripe**: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `STRIPE_PRICE_*` (9 price IDs)
- **Email**: `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`
- **Security**: `PHI_MASTER_KEY`, `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, `PHI_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED`
- **Redis**: `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`

## Key Workflows

**Intake flow:** Step-based wizard at `/request?service=<type>`. Managed by `lib/request/step-registry.ts`. Steps are React components in `components/request/steps/`. See ARCHITECTURE.md for full step sequences and data flows.

**Prescription workflow:** Patient submits → Doctor reviews in portal → Doctor inputs into Parchment (external eScript) → Doctor toggles "Script Sent" → Patient notified via email.

**Certificate pipeline:** Doctor approves → PDF generated → Uploaded to private Supabase Storage → Patient emailed dashboard link (not attachment). See ARCHITECTURE.md for 9-step generation flow.

**Phone number:** Required for prescriptions + consults + specialized pathways. NOT for med certs.

**Safety consent:** Merged INTO the review step (not a standalone step).

**Guest checkout:** Creates profile without `clerk_user_id` → Stripe checkout → redirects to `/auth/complete-account` for Clerk account linking.

**Referrals:** $5 credit to both parties. Patient shares `?ref=` link. UI: `components/patient/referral-card.tsx`.

### Key Pages

| Route | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/` | Marketing homepage (hero, service picker, how-it-works, testimonials, FAQ) |
| `/blog` | Doctor-reviewed health articles (12h ISR revalidation) |

## Brand & Voice

### Brand Essence

InstantMed represents **clarity emerging, not speed or disruption**. Calm authority, morning light, good judgment. If a design choice feels impressive but loud, it is wrong.

**Pillars:** (1) Clarity over speed — never prioritise urgency or hype. (2) Light as guidance — environmental and directional, never a graphic object. (3) Premium minimalism — every element justifies its existence. (4) Human, not clinical — reassuring, never sentimental or sterile.

### Voice

Professional but natural. Plainspoken and confident, with dry wit for relatability. Never stiff, never slangy. The goal is a balance — more polished than a text message, more human than a corporate brochure. If copy feels clever, edgy, salesy, or performative — rewrite.

- **Clear & plainspoken**: Everyday language, short sentences, minimal jargon. Say "fill in a form" not "complete your intake assessment"
- **Confident & expert**: State facts plainly, no hype, no hedging ("we aim to", "we try to"). No urgency language ("now", "fast", "instant")
- **Professional but approachable**: Friendly and direct, not overly casual. "A doctor reviews your request" not "Your boss won't bat an eye"
- **Dry wit**: Optional, max one subtle line per section. Should feel natural, not forced. Remove if it draws attention to itself

**Voice test:** Would this sound reasonable coming from a calm, experienced GP explaining their service to a patient? If it sounds like marketing copy or a Reddit post — rewrite.

### Medical Advertising Compliance

Prevents Google Ads disapproval and AHPRA scrutiny.

**Never use on landing pages:** medication names, drug classes, "prescription" as selling hook, "scripts/Rx/meds", guaranteed outcomes, instant approval language.

**Preferred framing:** Process-first, clinician-led. Use "doctor review", "medical assessment", "clinician-reviewed requests". Avoid "fast prescription delivery", "script renewal without seeing a doctor".

**"No call" rule:** Do NOT advertise async consults. Quietly reassure: "Most requests don't require a call" as secondary text only. Never in headlines or CTAs.

**CTAs:** Calm, non-salesy. Prefer "Get started", "Start your consult", "See how it works". Avoid "Get approved", "Instant access", "Skip the doctor".

### Visual Rules

**Color:** Morning spectrum — soft sky blue, pale ivory, soft peach, warm apricot, gentle champagne. Low saturation. **Semantic:** Primary `#3B82F6` (blue), Destructive `#F87171` (coral), Success `#22C55E` (green). **Prohibited:** purple/violet, neon, dark blues, pure black/white backgrounds. See ARCHITECTURE.md for full hex token table.

**Dark mode:** Supported via `darkMode: "class"` (default: light, `next-themes` provider). SkyToggle in navbar animates sun→moon. Dark palette is "Quiet Night Sky" — deep navy `#0B1120` background, teal primary `#5DB8C9`, muted warm accents. 1,295 `dark:` classes across 198 files. `BrandLogo` supports dark invert. Morning theme by day, night sky by dark — same brand, different time of day.

**Typography:** Source Sans 3 (sans) for all text — headings, body, UI. JetBrains Mono for code only. No serif, no decorative, no novelty fonts.

**Glass:** Frosted, not glossy. Shadows sky-toned, never black. See ARCHITECTURE.md for 4-level hierarchy.

**Motion:** 200-500ms, `ease-out`. No bounce, no elastic overshoot, max scale 1.02x.

**Shapes:** Rounded corners only (squircle preferred). No sharp or aggressive geometry.

**Emoji:** 0-1 per block, supporting signal only. Allowed: 🙂 👍 ⏱️ ✅ 🌤️ 🩺 (stethoscope exception for "how it works"). Forbidden: emojis in headings, medical emojis (💊💉), meme emojis.

**Rejection test:** Reject if it feels impressive but anxious, prioritises speed over confidence, resembles crypto/AI SaaS, feels like wellness marketing, or looks better at full size than as an icon.

## Gotchas

- **Build needs 8GB heap**: `NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192'` set in build/typecheck scripts
- **Controlled substances**: `lib/clinical/intake-validation.ts` hard-blocks Schedule 8 — no override
- **PHI encryption**: AES-256-GCM field-level. Controlled by `PHI_ENCRYPTION_*` env vars. See SECURITY.md
- **Rate limiting fallback**: Redis down → in-memory `Map` with 100 actions/hour
- **Certificate IDs**: `crypto.randomInt()` not `Math.random()` — security requirement
- **Name validation**: Unicode-aware `/^[\p{L}\s'-]+$/u` for international names
- **AHPRA validation**: Format check `/^[A-Z]{3}\d{10}$/` only — not a real AHPRA lookup
- **No template editor**: Certificates use static PDF templates in `/public/templates/` with `pdf-lib` text overlay — not a WYSIWYG editor
- **GP comparisons**: Kept but subtle — `text-xs text-muted-foreground`, no crossed-out prices
- **Curated testimonials**: 35+ realistic testimonials with real Australian locations/occupations — not inflated, not user-submitted
- **Doctor model**: System supports multiple doctors but currently operates with one. Don't advertise team size beyond what's real
- **E2E routes blocked in prod**: Middleware blocks `/api/test/*` and `/(dev)/*` in production/preview
- **Supabase migrations**: 150+. Use `supabase db push`. May need `supabase migration repair` for drift
- **Tailwind v4**: CSS-first config. Custom morning spectrum colors (sky, dawn, ivory)
