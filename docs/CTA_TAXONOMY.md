# CTA Taxonomy & Guidelines

## Problem Statement

Current CTAs across the site are **generic and ambiguous**:
- "Get started" — Started with what?
- "Start" — Start what exactly?
- "Start now" — What happens when I click?

This creates hesitation for SEO-driven traffic who arrive with **specific intent** (e.g., searching "medical certificate online").

## CTA Design Principles

### 1. **Describe the Action + Outcome**
Bad: "Get started"
Good: "Request your certificate"

### 2. **Match Page Intent**
- **Informational pages**: Softer CTAs ("See how it works", "Learn more")
- **Transactional pages**: Direct CTAs ("Request your certificate", "Renew my prescription")

### 3. **Service-Specific Language**
Replace generic "Get started" with service-relevant verbs:
- Medical certificates → "Request", "Get"
- Prescriptions → "Renew", "Request"
- General consults → "Book", "Start"

### 4. **Reduce Cognitive Load**
The CTA should answer: "What happens when I click this?"

### Services Section (Featured Cards)

### Service Picker Cards
| Service | Before | After | Rationale |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------|

| Med Cert (Study) | "Start now" | "Request certificate" | Consistent across cert types |
| Repeat Prescription | "Start now" | "Renew prescription" | Service-specific |

| Medication section | "Request your medication" | ✓ Keep | Already service-specific |
| How it works CTA | "Get started now" | "Renew your medication" | Softer, implies existing relationship |

## Verb Hierarchy by Service

### Medical Certificates
**Primary**: "Request" (formal, appropriate for medical context)
**Alternative**: "Get" (casual, for informal contexts)
**Avoid**: "Apply for" (implies approval uncertainty)

### Repeat Prescriptions
**Primary**: "Renew" (implies existing relationship)
**Alternative**: "Request" (for new users)
**Avoid**: "Get" (too casual for medication)

### General Consults
**Primary**: "Book" (familiar pattern)
**Alternative**: "Start" (for intake flow)
**Avoid**: "Schedule" (implies specific time)

## Compliance Notes

Per brand voice guidelines:
- ✓ "Request your certificate" — Professional, clear
- ✓ "Renew your prescription" — Implies existing care
- ✗ "Get approved" — Implies guaranteed outcome
- ✗ "Get your script" — Too casual, "script" is slang
- ✗ "Instant access" — Implies immediacy we can't guarantee

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics post-implementation:
1. **Click-through rate** on primary CTAs
2. **Bounce rate** on landing pages
3. **Time to first interaction** (reduced hesitation)
4. **Conversion rate** by traffic source (especially organic)
